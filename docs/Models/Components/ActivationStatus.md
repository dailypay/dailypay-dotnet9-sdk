# ActivationStatus

Activation is the process of verifying that data is available for a Job,  and that a person has verified their identity as the Person associated with the Job. Only paychecks from Jobs with `activated` status will contribute to an earnings balance account.

To deactivate a job, update activation_status to `DEACTIVATED`.
