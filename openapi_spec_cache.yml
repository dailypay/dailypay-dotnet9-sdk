                **Special note for earnings_balance-type accounts:**
                During a typical pay period, if a user transfers no money from an earnings_balance-type account to a personal account, 
                the `current` balance will generally be 0, because transfers from earnings to this account will be 
                PENDING until the paycheck related to those earnings is processed. 
                Pending inflows are included in the `available` balance, not the `current` balance.
                 
                If a user transfers money from an earnings_balance-type account to a personal account, 
                the `current` balance will be negative as those transfers settle. When a paycheck is processed, 
                DailyPay will automatically attempt to zero out the balance, 
                transferring any remaining funds to the `default_paycheck_destination` set for the associated Job.

                If DailyPay is unable to zero out the balance during paycheck processing, the `current` balance will remain negative, 
                which may impact a user's ability to transfer additional funds from their earnings balance. 
                In those cases, the available balance will be 0.
